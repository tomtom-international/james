Behavior changes:
0. There is impossible to set InformationPoint on method in childClass that is inherited from superClass.
   Example:

   class AAA {
     public void xxx() {

     }
   }

   class BBB extends AAA {

   }

   It's not allowed to configure IP on BBB#xxx(), but you can set IP on AAA#xxx() and in groovy script check if origin is instance of required type.
